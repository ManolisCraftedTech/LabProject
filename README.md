<h1>Setting Up the Bare-Metal System:</h1>

I repurposed my old computer, turning it into a dedicated bare-metal system for hosting virtual machines.

- MOTHERBOARD: M5A97 R2.0 ASUSTEK
- CPU: AMF FX-8350 4Mhz 8 core
- RAM: ddr3 24 Gigabytes XMP P.1 OC
- Gpu: Nvidia  GTX 650
- SSD: 1 TB SAMSUNG EVO 

⚫I employed VMware as the go-to tool for efficiently managing and overseeing my virtual machines.
Optimizing Security with PfSense:

⚫I configured a PfSense firewall meticulously. This step ensured not only optimal security but also enhanced performance within the lab environment.
